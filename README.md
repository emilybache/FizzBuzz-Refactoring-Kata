FizzBuzz Refactoring Kata
=========================

_Support this and all my katas on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/EmilyBache)_

Refactor this code so that adding the new feature is very easy. "Make the change easy, then make the easy change".

The existing behaviour and new desired feature are described on [the Samman website](https://sammancoaching.org/kata_descriptions/fizzbuzz.html).

'demo' branch
-------------
The branch 'demo' contains the code you might end up with after doing a preparatory refactoring. There is a recording of this demo in [Java](https://youtu.be/kHwzVlXTOw8)
